Express - React - Node
Basic weather api.

Creates a JSON endpoint
Fetches data from that end point with a search term
Search term is then geocoded to lat and long with Mapbox API
Then the Dark Sky API returns the data to the JSON endpoint

Fetch returns all that data which is then rendered with React.
